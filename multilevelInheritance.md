let myArray = [];

- lets define an array and call it myArray. Now lets inspect it, it has a prototype which we can call the arrayBase and in the prototype we have all the array methods e.g. push, pull map, filter etc. So myArray derives from arrayBase. Now if we inspect further down we’d find out that arrayBase itself has a prototype which is objectBase or root object in JS. So myArray derived from arrayBase and arrayBase derived from objectBase. This is what we call multilevel inheritance.


- Another Example: We have a constructor function Circle and then we create a circle object using the constructor Circle. If we inspect the circle object, we’d find out that circle object that we created using the Circle Constructor has a prototype, and this prototype is the prototype for all circle objects we create using our circle constructor. Let’s call this circleBase. So everytime we call Circle constructor to create a new object and set it’s prototype property to circleBase. In other words objects created by given constructor will have the same prototype. so all object created by circle will have the same prototype that is circleBase and circleBase has the prototype called objectBase
