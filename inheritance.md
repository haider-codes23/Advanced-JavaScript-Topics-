- Core concepts of OOP, that enables an object to take on the properties and methods of another object. And this makes it easy to reuse code in different parts of an application. Lets say we have a class called Circle and Square, they both have this method called computeOptimumSize().

- Now instead of implementing this function separately in both the classes we can instead create another class called shape and implement a computeSize() method in that class. And Circle and Square inherit this method.

- The Shape class is referred to as Base Class or Super Class or Parent Class. In contrast we refer to the Circle and Square class as Child Class or Sub Class or Derived Class. And finally we refer to the inheritance relationship as IS-A relationship. So we say circle IS-A shape. This is the classical explanation definition of inheritance but in JS we dont have Classes, we only have objects. So that’s when Prototypical Inheritance comes in to picture. So basically we have to types of inheritance Classical and prototypical

### Prototypical Inheritance

- In JS we don’t have classes we have objects. So how can we implement inheritance only using Objects. Now lets say we have a circle class and another object called shape and add all the methods in the shape object e.g. computeSize() etc. And then somehow we can link the circle object with shape object. Now we’ll refer the shape object as the prototype of the circle object. So prototype is a parent ob another object.
- Every object in JS has a prototype/ parent and it inherits all the member defined in it’s prototype. Lets prove it. If we create a variable x using let and then initialize it with an object literal, and then inspect it we would find out that empty object has a prototype which is Object e.g. it has it’s own methods like constructor function, hasOwnProperty which is also a method, then toString method. So we have this x object in the memory and x has a link to another object which is it’s prototype, lets call it objectBase. FYI It’s not official term. Every object in JS directly or indirectly inherits from objectBase. objectBase is the root of all objects in JS, and it doesn’t have a prototype or a parent. Now to prove that this is right lets create another empty object, call it y. Then use Object.getPrototypeOf() on both x and y and compare there return values, which evaluates to true.
- Prototypical Inheritance: When we use the toString() method on x using dot notation, we didn’t define this method for the x object, x was an empty object, so how does this work ? how can we access this method ?? Well When we access a property or method on an object, JS engine first looks for that property or method on the object itself, if it cant find it, it looks in the prototype for that object all the way up to the root Object which we called the objectBase.
